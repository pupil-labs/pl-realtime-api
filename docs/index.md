!!! note "Real-Time API Compatibility"

    This package is designed for use with Pupil Invisible and Neon. If you're using a different eye tracker, like Pupil Core, it would not be compatible.
    If you need streaming capabilities for Pupil Core, please check out the [Pupil Core Network API](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/developer/network-api/).
